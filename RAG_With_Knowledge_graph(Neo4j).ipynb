              "[Document(metadata={'title': 'Elizabeth I', 'summary': 'Elizabeth I (7 September 1533 – 24 March 1603) was Queen of England and Ireland from 17 November 1558 until her death in 1603. She was the last monarch of the House of Tudor.\\nElizabeth was the only surviving child of Henry VIII and his second wife, Anne Boleyn. When Elizabeth was two years old, her parents\\' marriage was annulled, her mother was executed, and Elizabeth was declared illegitimate. Henry restored her to the line of succession when she was 10, via the Third Succession Act 1543. After Henry\\'s death in 1547, Elizabeth\\'s younger half-brother Edward VI ruled until his own death in 1553, bequeathing the crown to a Protestant cousin, Lady Jane Grey, and ignoring the claims of his two half-sisters, the Catholic Mary and the younger Elizabeth, in spite of statutes to the contrary. Edward\\'s will was set aside within weeks of his death and Mary became queen, deposing and executing Jane. During Mary\\'s reign, Elizabeth was imprisoned for nearly a year on suspicion of supporting Protestant rebels.\\nUpon her half-sister\\'s death in 1558, Elizabeth succeeded to the throne and set out to rule by good counsel.

Her parents were Peter the Great, Tsar of Russia and Catherine. Catherine was the daughter of Samuel Skowroński, a subject of Grand Duchy of Lithuania. Although no documentary record exists, her parents were said to have married secretly at the Cathedral of the Holy Trinity in Saint Petersburg at some point between 23 October and 1 December 1707. Their official marriage was at Saint Isaac\\'s Cathedral in Saint Petersburg on 9 February 1712. On this day, the two children previously born to the couple (Anna and Elizabeth) were legitimised by their father and given the title of Tsarevna (\"princess\") on 6 March 1711. Of the twelve children born to Peter and Catherine (five sons and seven daughters), only the sisters survived to adulthood. They had one older surviving sibling, crown prince Alexei Petrovich, who was Peter\\'s son by his first wife, noblewoman Eudoxia Lopukhina.\\nAs a child, Elizabeth was the favourite of her father, whom she resembled both physically and temperamentally. Even though he adored his daughter, Peter did not devote time or attention to her education; having both a son and grandson from his first marriage to a noblewoman, he did not anticipate that a daughter born to his former maid might one day inherit the Russian throne, which had until that point never been occupied by a woman; as such, it was left to Catherine to raise the girls, a task met with considerable difficulty due to her own lack of education.

The portrait miniature developed from the illuminated manuscript tradition. These small personal images were almost invariably painted from life over the space of a few days in watercolours on vellum, stiffened by being glued to a playing card. Panel paintings in oils on prepared wood surfaces were based on preparatory drawings and were usually executed at life size, as were oil paintings on canvas.\\nUnlike her contemporaries in France, Elizabeth never granted rights to produce her portrait to a single artist, although Nicholas Hilliard was appointed her official limner, or miniaturist and goldsmith. George Gower, a fashionable court portraitist created Serjeant Painter in 1581, was responsible for approving all portraits of the queen created by other artists from 1581 until his death in 1596.\\nElizabeth sat for a number of artists over the years, including Hilliard, Cornelis Ketel, Federico Zuccaro or Zuccari, Isaac Oliver, and most likely to Gower and Marcus Gheeraerts the Younger. Portraits were commissioned by the government as gifts to foreign monarchs and to show to prospective suitors. Courtiers commissioned heavily symbolic paintings to demonstrate their devotion to the queen, and the fashionable long galleries of later Elizabethan country houses were filled with sets of portraits. The studios of Tudor artists produced images of Elizabeth working from approved \"face patterns\", or approved drawings of the queen, to meet this growing demand for her image, an important symbol of loyalty and reverence for the crown in times of turbulence.\\n\\n\\n=== European context ===\\n\\nBy far the most impressive models of portraiture available to English portraitists were the many portraits by Hans Holbein the Younger, the outstanding Northern portraitist of the first half of the 16th century, who had made two lengthy visits to England, and had been Henry VIII\\'s court artist. Holbein had accustomed the English court to the full-length life-size portrait, although none of his originals now survive. His great dynastic mural at Whitehall Palace, destroyed in 1698, and perhaps other original large portraits, would have been familiar to Elizabethan artists.\\nBoth Holbein and his great Italian contemporary Titian had combined great psychological penetration with a sufficiently majestic impression to satisfy their royal patrons. By his second visit, Holbein had already begun to move away from a strictly realist depiction; in his Jane Seymour, \"the figure is no longer seen as displacing with its bulk a recognizable section of space: it approaches rather to a flat pattern, made alive by a bounding and vital outline\". This tendency was to be taken much further by the later portraits of Elizabeth, where \"Likeness of feature and an interest in form and volume have gradually been abandoned in favour of an effect of splendid majesty obtained by decorative pattern, and the forms have been flattened accordingly\".\\n\\nTitian continued to paint royal portraits, especially of Philip II of Spain, until the 1570s, but in sharply reduce')]"

It is a fermented beverage most often made from\\n   malted barley, hops, yeast and water, and is carbonated in almost all\\n   cases. By altering the production method (changes in time and\\n   temperature, for example) or the ingredients, a staggeringly wide\\n   variety of different types of beer can be produced. Much like fine\\n   wines, many beers can also be aged and evolve into beverages that defy\\n   the common definitions of beer.\\n\\nHistory\\n\\n   Beer is one of the oldest human-produced beverages, possibly dating\\n   back to at least the 7th millennium BC (perhaps prior even to bread),\\n   and recorded in the written history of Ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia.\\n   Earliest known chemical evidence of beer dates to circa 3500-3100 BC.\\n   As almost any substance containing carbohydrates, namely sugar or\\n   starch, can naturally undergo fermentation, it is likely that beer-like\\n   beverages were independently invented among various cultures throughout\\n   the world.\\n\\n   In Egypt, Mesopotamia, and the Levant, large-scale production of beer\\n   was common. In Europe, beer was being produced by or for monasteries as\\n   early as the 7th century. By the 14th and 15th centuries, beer had\\n   achieved great popularity, at least in part because health epidemics\\n   made drinking beer safer than drinking water. However it was not until\\n   the 17th century, according to Michael Jackson, that beer took on the\\n   styles and flavours that we might recognise in the beers of today.\\n\\n   Today, the brewing industry is a huge global business, consisting of\\n   several multinational companies, and many thousands of smaller\\n   producers ranging from brewpubs to regional breweries.\\n\\nBrewing\\n\\n   Though the process of brewing beer is complex and varies\")),\n",

There may be\\n   additional filtration steps between stages.\\n   Enlarge\\n    1. Mashing: The first phase of brewing, in which the malted grains are\\n       crushed and soaked in warm water in order to create a malt extract.\\n       The mash is held at constant temperature long enough for enzymes to\\n       convert starches into fermentable sugars, usually about 45 to 90\\n       minutes, depending on mash temperature (high temperatures =\\n       faster). The temperature is typically held at either a single\\n       temperature (single step) or a series of temperatures depending on\\n       the enzymes one wants to focus on. Typically with modern\\n       fully-modified malts, a single-stage infusion is all that is\\n       required. For most mashes, a temperature between 65-67°C\\n       (150-154°F) is typical, with higher temperatures yielding fuller\\n       bodied beers, and lower temperatures yielding more fermentable and\\n       lighter bodied beers. Multi-temperature mashes are used for\\n       acid-buffering reactions and protein rests for head-retention for\\n       some types of malts.\\n    2. Sparging: Water is filtered through the mash to dissolve the\\n       sugars. The darker, sugar-heavy liquid is called the wort.\\n       Typically the rinse water (sparge) is held between 76-82°C\\n       (170-180°F) to (1) keep sugars and gums from setting up and (2)\\n       above 82°C (180°F), tannin extraction could be a problem.\\n    3.

Bennett).\\n   Hops contain several characteristics very favourable to beer: (a) hops\\n   contribute a bitterness that balances the sweetness of the malt, (b)\\n   hops also contribute aromas which range from flowery to citrus to\\n   herbal, (c) hops have an antibiotic effect that favours the activity of\\n   brewer\\'s yeast over less desirable microorganisms and (d) the use of\\n   hops aids in \" head retention\", the length of time that a foamy head\\n   created by the beer\\'s carbonation agent will last. The bitterness of\\n   commercially-brewed beers is measured on the International Bitterness\\n   Units scale. While hop plants are grown by farmers all around the world\\n   in many different varieties, there is no major commercial use for hops\\n   other than in beer.\\n\\nYeast\\n\\n   A microorganism that is responsible for fermentation. A specific strain\\n   of yeast is chosen depending on the type of beer being produced, the\\n   two main strains being ale yeast ( Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and lager\\n   yeast ( Saccharomyces uvarum), with some other variations available,\\n   such as Brettanomyces and Torulaspora delbrueckii. Yeast will\\n   metabolise the sugars extracted from the grains, and produce alcohol\\n   and carbon dioxide as a result. Before yeast\\'s functions were\\n   understood, fermentations were conducted naturally using wild or\\n   airborne yeasts; although a few styles such as lambics still rely on\\n   this ancient method, most modern fermentations are conducted using pure\\n   yeast cultures.\\n\\nClarifying agent\\n\\n   Some brewers add one or more clarifying agents to beer that are not\\n   required to be published as ingredients.

The\\n   important distinction for ales is that they are fermented at higher\\n   temperatures and thus ferment more quickly than lagers.\\n\\n   Ale is typically fermented at temperatures between 15 and 24 °C (60 and\\n   75 °F). At these temperatures, yeast produces significant amounts of\\n   esters and other secondary flavour and aroma products, and the result\\n   is often a beer with slightly \"fruity\" compounds resembling but not\\n   limited to apple, pear, pineapple, banana, plum, or prune. Typical ales\\n   have a sweeter, fuller body than lagers.\\n\\n   Differences between some ales and lagers can be difficult to\\n   categorise. Steam beer, Kölsch, Alt and some modern British Golden\\n   Summer Beers use elements of both lager and ale production. Baltic\\n   Porter and Bière de Garde may be produced by either lager or ale\\n   methods or a combination of both.

They are the most commonly-consumed beer in the world.\\n   The name comes from the German lagern (\"to store\"). Lager yeast is a\\n   bottom-fermenting yeast, and typically undergoes primary fermentation\\n   at 7-12 °C (45-55 °F) (the \"fermentation phase\"), and then is given a\\n   long secondary fermentation at 0-4 °C (32-40 °F) (the \"lagering\\n   phase\"). During the secondary stage, the lager clears and mellows. The\\n   cooler conditions also inhibit the natural production of esters and\\n   other byproducts, resulting in a \"crisper\" tasting beer.\\n\\n   Modern methods of producing lager were pioneered by Gabriel Sedlmayr\\n   the Younger, who perfected dark brown lagers at the Spaten Brewery in\\n   Bavaria, and Anton Dreher, who began brewing a lager, probably of\\n   amber-red colour, in Vienna in 1840–1841.')),\n",

See Filtered beer. But some\\n   are bottle conditioned.\\n\\n   Bottle conditioned beers are unfiltered and unpasteurised. It is\\n   usually recommended that the beer is poured slowly, leaving any yeast\\n   sediment at the bottom of the bottle. However, some drinkers prefer to\\n   pour in the yeast, and this practice is customary with wheat beers.\\n   Typically when serving a hefeweizen 90% of the contents is poured and\\n   the remainder swirled to suspend the sediment before pouring it into\\n   the glass.\\n\\nCans\\n\\n   A lot of beer is sold in beer cans, though there is considerable\\n   variation in the proportion between different countries. In Sweden 60%\\n   of beer is sold in cans, in Denmark none at all. People either drink\\n   from the can or pour the beer into a glass. Cans are commonly\\n   associated with cheap, mass-produced American beer such as Budwieser\\n   and Miller. Imported and micro-brewed beers are usually purchased in\\n   beer bottles.\\n\\nServing temperature\\n\\n   The temperature of a beer has an influence on a drinker\\'s experience.\\n   Colder temperatures allow fully attenuated beers such as pale lagers to\\n   be enjoyed for their crispness; while warmer temperatures allow the\\n   more rounded flavours of an ale or a stout to be perceived. Beer writer\\n   Michael Jackson proposes a five-level scale for serving temperatures:\\n   well chilled (7°C/45°F) for \"light\" beers (American and Australian\\n   lagers), chilled (8°C/47°F) for Berliner Weisse, lightly chilled\\n   (9C/48F) for European lagers, all dark lagers, altbier and German wheat\\n   beers, cellar temperature (13°C/55°F) for regular British ale, stout\\n   and most Belgian specialities and room temperature (15.5°C/60°F) for\\n   strong dark ales (especially trappist) and barley wine.\\n\\nCulture\\n\\n   Gambrinus - king of beer\\n   Enlarge\\n   Gambrinus - king of beer\\n\\nSocial context\\n\\n   Various social traditions and activities are associated with beer\\n   drinking,')),\n",

In\\n   fact, beer is sometimes referred to as \"liquid bread\" . Typically, the\\n   darker the brew, the more nutrient dense, with some sources maintaining\\n   that filtered beer loses much of its nutrition ,.\\n\\n   A 2005 Japanese study found that non-alcoholic beer may possess strong\\n   anti-cancer properties. Another study found nonalcoholic beer to mirror\\n   the cardiovascular benefits associated with moderate consumption of\\n   alcoholic beverages.\\n\\n   It is considered that over-eating and lack of muscle tone is the main\\n   cause of a beer belly, rather than beer consumption. A recent study,\\n   however, found a link between binge drinking and a beer belly. But with\\n   most overconsumption it is more a problem of improper exercise and\\n   overconsumption of carbohydrates than the product itself .\\n\\n   There is strong evidence that prolonged consumption of alcohol,\\n   especially in high volumes, can not only lead to liver damage but\\n   leaves the organ vulnerable to cancer cells.\\n\\nStrength\\n\\n   The alcohol content of beers varies by local custom. British ales\\n   average around 4% abv, while Belgian beers tend to average 8% abv. The\\n   strength of the typical global pale lager is 5% abv.\\n\\n   Typical brewing yeast cannot reproduce (and therefore cannot produce\\n   alcohol) above 12% abv. However, in the 1980s the Swiss brewery\\n   Hürlimann developed a yeast strain which could get as high as 14% for\\n   their Samich')),\n",

The\\n   important distinction for ales is that they are fermented at higher\\n   temperatures and thus ferment more quickly than lagers.\\n\\n   Ale is typically fermented at temperatures between 15 and 24 °C (60 and\\n   75 °F). At these temperatures, yeast produces significant amounts of\\n   esters and other secondary flavour and aroma products, and the result\\n   is often a beer with slightly \"fruity\" compounds resembling but not\\n   limited to apple, pear, pineapple, banana, plum, or prune. Typical ales\\n   have a sweeter, fuller body than lagers.\\n\\n   Differences between some ales and lagers can be difficult to\\n   categorise. Steam beer, Kölsch, Alt and some modern British Golden\\n   Summer Beers use elements of both lager and ale production. Baltic\\n   Porter and Bière de Garde may be produced by either lager or ale\\n   methods or a combination of both. However, lager production is\\n   perceived to produce cleaner tasting, dryer and lighter beer than ale.\\n\\nLager\\n\\n   A stein of lager\\n   Enlarge\\n   A stein of lager\\n\\n   Lager is the English name for bottom-fermenting beers of Central\\n   European origin. They are the most commonly-consumed beer in the world.\\n   The name comes from the German lagern (\"to store\"). Lager yeast is a\\n   bottom-fermenting yeast, and typically undergoes primary fermentation\\n   at 7-12 °C (45-55 °F) (the \"fermentation phase\"), and then is given a\\n   long secondary fermentation at 0-4 °C (32-40 °F) (the \"lagering\\n   phase\"). During the secondary stage, the lager clears and mellows. The\\n   cooler conditions also inhibit the natural production of esters and\\n   other byproducts, resulting in a \"crisper\" tasting beer.\\n\\n   Modern methods of producing lager were pioneered by Gabriel Sedlmayr\\n   the Younger, who perfected dark brown lagers at the Spaten Brewery in\\n   Bavaria, and Anton Dreher, who began brewing a lager, probably of\\n   amber-red colour, in Vienna in 1840–1841.'),\n",
